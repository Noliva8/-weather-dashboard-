# -weather-dashboard-
This is a great application that can be used to check the weather across the cities of the globe. This is how it works:

 search for a city
you will be presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
click on the current to check the current weather conditions for that city
THEN you will be presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
when you view the future weather conditions for that city
then you will be presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN you click on a city in the search history
you will again presented with current and future conditions for that city
